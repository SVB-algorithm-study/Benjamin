# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
I thought I need to sum the elements of input array `nums` gradually.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
I made a new array `answer` and appended elements while summing `nums[i]`

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$, 27ms, where `n` is lengh of input array `nums`
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $O(n)$, 13.4MB, The space used by answer depends on `n` is length of input array `nums`.
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution(object):
    def runningSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """

        answer = [0]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            answer.append(answer[-1]+nums[i])
        return answer[1:]
```
